        forms: ture,
        checkers: ture,
      ),
      other: (
        badge: true,
        table: true,
        alert: true,
        slider: true,
      ),
      awesome: (
        prototype: ture,

  every component has value true it will be rendered
  
  ```scss main.scss focus=4:8,11:14,17
  @use "basket" as * with (
    $components: (
      base: (
        button: ture,
        navbar: ture,
        card: ture,
        forms: ture,
        checkers: ture,
      ),
      other: (
        badge: true,
        table: true,
        alert: true,
        slider: true,
      ),
      awesome: (
        prototype: ture,
      ),

  theming or color system is a dilemma
  
  ```html index.html
  <!-- ... -->
  ```

  ---
  
  we could make every component have its own color system, but that would be more complicated in the future,
  and that a preformace issues becuse every component has its own color system meaning when we have more components more load and space ( preformace issues ) but it's the easiest why
  
  
  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn-primary"></button>
  <span class="badge-primary"></span>
  <div class="navbar-primary"></div>
  <div class="alert-primary"></div>
  ```

  ---
  
  it could be like this better for preformace but not that much and still generating  color system for every component 

  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn btn-primary"></button>
  <span class="badge badge-primary"></span>
  <div class="navbar navbar-primary"></div>
  <div class="alert alert-primary"></div>
  ```
  ---
  
  it could be like this better for preformace but is not easy at all

  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn bg-purple-600 text-white"></button>
  <span class="badge bg-purple-600 text-white"></span>
  <div class="navbar bg-purple-600 text-white"></div>
  <div class="alert bg-purple-600 text-white"></div>
  ```

  ---
  
  or it could be like this much better

  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn primary"></button>
  <span class="badge primary"></span>
  <div class="navbar primary"></div>
  <div class="alert primary"></div>
  ```

  ---

  theme works with this component 

  ```html index.html

  ```
  ---

  but one theme is not enough? okay

  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn primary"></button>
  <button class="btn primary-flat"></button>
  <button class="btn outlined e:primary"></button>
  ```
  ---

  event color when the effect is not text and background, but hovering or a changing frame ( border , shadow ), for example

  ```html index.html
  <button class="btn outlined e:secondary"></button>
  <input class="switch e:secondary" type="checkbox" />
  <input class="radio e:secondary" type="radio" />
  <input class="checkbox e:secondary" type="checkbox" />
  <input class="form e:secondary" type="email" />
  ```
  ---

  for theming

  ```scss main.scss
  @use "basket" as * with (
    $ui-colors: true,
  );
  ```
